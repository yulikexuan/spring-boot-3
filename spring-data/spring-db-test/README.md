# Spring Boot - DB Testing 

Hi, I know I need dependency org.flywaydb:flyway-core to use flyway for db migration, but I don't know if I need dependency org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql. Do you know why?

For using Flyway with PostgreSQL, the core dependency org.flywaydb:flyway-core is essential, as it contains the core functionality of Flyway including the migration engine.
The org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql dependency is optional and provides Flyway with access to PostgreSQL-specific extensions that can enhance integration and add features tailored to PostgreSQL databases.
Here is a summary of when you might need org.flywaydb:flyway-database-postgresql:
Advanced PostgreSQL Features: If you need advanced support for PostgreSQL-specific extensions and features that are not handled by the core Flyway libraries.
Performance Improvements: The PostgreSQL-specific driver may include performance optimizations for database operations running on PostgreSQL.
Enhanced Compatibility: Ensures compatibility with PostgreSQL's unique behaviors and functionalities that may not be efficiently managed by generic SQL drivers.
However, in most cases, the core Flyway library should be sufficient to handle standard database migration tasks on PostgreSQL.
For completeness, here is an example of how you might include these dependencies in your pom.xml file if you are using Maven:

<dependency>
<groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
<artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
<version>9.1.0</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
<artifactId>flyway-database-postgresql</artifactId>
<version>9.1.0</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>

If you do not have any PostgreSQL-specific requirements, you can proceed with just the flyway-core dependency. The PostgreSQL support within Flyway Core often suffices for standard migration needs.

also, do you know what "spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate" means for spring boot?

Certainly! In Spring Boot, the spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate property specifies whether Flyway should automatically baseline the database on migrate.
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate
Type: boolean
Default Value: false
Explanation:
When this property is set to true, Flyway will automatically baseline the database on migrate if it detects that the flyway_schema_history table is missing. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have an existing database and you want to start using Flyway for version control of your database schema without having to migrate existing database schema versions.
Use Cases:
Existing Database: If you have an existing database without any Flyway history table and you want to start using Flyway, setting spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true allows Flyway to create a baseline for the current state of the database.
Legacy Systems: When integrating Flyway into a legacy system where the schema has been managed manually, this property helps to bring the existing state under Flyway's control without requiring all past migrations to be re-run.
Configuration:
You can set this property in your application.properties or application.yml file.
application.properties:

spring:
flyway:
baseline-on-migrate: true

Example Scenario:
Suppose you have a database that has been manually managed until now, and its current state doesn't have any Flyway history. If you start using Flyway and set spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true, Flyway will create a baseline version (V1__Baseline) and start keeping track of migrations from there onwards.
This ensures that Flyway does not reapply migrations to an already existing schema, thus avoiding potential conflicts or data loss.

So, could you tell me how to use flyway without setting spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true ?

Certainly! If you prefer not to set spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true, you can still integrate Flyway with an existing database by manually creating a baseline. Here's how you can do it:
Steps to Use Flyway without spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true
Identify the Current State of Your Database Schema:
Determine the current version of your database schema. For example, if your schema is at version 1.0, you will create a baseline for this version.
Manually Baseline Your Database:
Use the Flyway command-line tool or a direct SQL command to create the baseline version in the flyway_schema_history table (previously known as schema_version).
Add Flyway to Your Spring Boot Application:
Ensure the Flyway dependencies are included in your pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle).
Create a Baseline Migration Script:
Create an SQL script that represents the current state of your schema. Name it something like V1__Baseline.sql.
Place this script in the Flyway migrations directory (by default src/main/resources/db/migration).
Configure Flyway in application.properties or application.yml:
Set the baseline version in your configuration file to match the version you identified in step 1.
Example:
Suppose your current schema version is 1.0.
SQL Baseline Script (V1__Baseline.sql):

spring:
flyway:
baseline-version: 1.0
baseline-on-migrate: false

Run Baseline Command:
You can manually baseline the database using the Flyway command-line tool:

dd New Migrations:
From this point on, any new SQL migrations should be versioned starting after the baseline version (e.g., V1.1__Add_New_Table.sql, V2.0__Update_Existing_Table.sql, etc.).
Example Baseline Process Using Flyway Command-Line:
Create the Baseline Version:
Add Future Migrations: Place future migration scripts in the src/main/resources/db/migration directory and ensure they are properly versioned (e.g., V1.1__Add_New_Feature.sql).
Following these steps will allow you to integrate Flyway into your Spring Boot application while maintaining control over the baseline process, without automatically enabling baseline-on-migrate.

Actually, I mean how to set up flyway from beginning? I mean assume there is no database created at all. Thanks!

Got it! If you're setting up Flyway for database migrations from scratch, here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started.
Setting Up Flyway in a Spring Boot Application from Scratch
1. Include Flyway Dependency in Your Project:
   First, add the necessary Flyway dependency to your project. If you’re using Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    <version>9.1.0</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>

2. Configure Data Source in application.properties or application.yml:
   Configure your database connection properties in the application configuration file. For example, here are properties for a PostgreSQL database.
   application.properties:

spring:
datasource:
url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
username: myuser
password: mypassword
driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver

flyway:
enabled: true
locations: classpath:db/migration

3. Create Your First Database Migration Script:
   Create a directory named db/migration under src/main/resources if it doesn’t already exist. Then, create your initial SQL migration file inside that directory.
   src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__Create_initial_tables.sql:

-- Create initial tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example_table (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

4. Run Your Spring Boot Application:
   When you start your Spring Boot application, Flyway will automatically detect the migration scripts in the db/migration directory and apply them to create the database schema.
5. Verify Database Creation:
   Check your PostgreSQL database to verify that the example_table and the Flyway schema history table (flyway_schema_history) have been created.

Adding Further Migrations
When you need to add subsequent migrations, simply create new SQL files with an incremented version number:
src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__Add_new_column.sql:

-- Add a new column to example_table
ALTER TABLE example_table ADD COLUMN description TEXT;


I also use p6spy-spring-boot-starter for my spring boot app, do you know how to make it not print out sql statements of running flyway's db migration scripts in folder db/migration

Certainly! To prevent p6spy from logging SQL statements generated by Flyway's migrations, you can configure p6spy to ignore these specific SQL statements. Here's how you can achieve this:
Step-by-Step Guide
Install the p6spy Dependency: Ensure you have the p6spy-spring-boot-starter dependency in your pom.xml (for Maven) or build.gradle (for Gradle).
pom.xml:

   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.github.gavlyukovskiy</groupId>
       <artifactId>p6spy-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
       <version>1.5.6</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
   </dependency>

Configure p6spy to Ignore Flyway SQL Statements:
p6spy uses a configuration file named spy.properties to control its behavior. You can customize the spy.properties file to filter out SQL statements generated by Flyway.
Create src/main/resources/spy.properties:

p6spy.config.logMessageFormat=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.SingleLineFormat
p6spy.config.appender=com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.Slf4JLogger
p6spy.config.logfile=target/spy.log
p6spy.config.filter=true
p6spy.config.exclude=org.flywaydb.core.internal.*

# You can add additional filters if needed

p6spy.config.filter=true: Enables filtering of SQL statements.
p6spy.config.exclude=org.flywaydb.core.internal.*: Excludes Flyway's internal SQL logging.
Setup Logging (Optional):
If you prefer to log SQL statements to a specific file or logger, configure p6spy accordingly in the spy.properties file.
Restart Your Application:
After making these changes, restart your Spring Boot application. p6spy should now exclude SQL statements executed by Flyway during database migrations.
Additional Notes
If you have specific needs for filtering, you can customize the p6spy.config.exclude property with more precise patterns to match the Flyway classes or packages you're looking to exclude.
The logging format and appender are configurable. You can use com.p6spy.engine.spy.appender.CustomLineFormat for more custom formats if needed.
By following these steps, you should be able to prevent p6spy from logging Flyway's migration SQL statements, ensuring a cleaner SQL log output for your application.
