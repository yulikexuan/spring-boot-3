# Virtual Threads Presentation Guide for Management

## Presentation Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Brief explanation of the current thread pool implementation
- Overview of virtual threads (Project Loom) and their purpose

### 2. Technical Benefits
- How virtual threads work compared to platform threads
- Why they're more memory-efficient
- How they can improve throughput for I/O-bound applications

### 3. Evidence & Benchmarks
- Comparative benchmarks (which I'll help you prepare)
- Memory usage metrics
- Scalability improvements

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- Migration approach
- Code changes required
- Risk assessment

### 5. Business Value
- Cost savings (infrastructure/cloud)
- Improved user experience
- Competitive advantage


## Evidence Gathering

To make a compelling case, let's gather evidence through benchmarks.
Here's how you can demonstrate the benefits:

### 1. Memory Footprint Comparison
Create a simple benchmark application that:
1. Creates N tasks with platform threads (thread pool)
2. Creates the same N tasks with virtual threads
3. Measures memory usage in both scenarios

```
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.time.Duration;

public class ThreadMemoryComparison {

    private static final int THREAD_COUNT = 10_000;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Measure with platform threads
        long platformMemoryUsage = measureMemoryUsage(() -> {
            try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(200)) {
                executeBlockingTasks(executor, THREAD_COUNT);
            }
        });

        // Measure with virtual threads
        long virtualMemoryUsage = measureMemoryUsage(() -> {
            try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
                executeBlockingTasks(executor, THREAD_COUNT);
            }
        });

        System.out.println("Platform threads memory usage: " + platformMemoryUsage + " MB");
        System.out.println("Virtual threads memory usage: " + virtualMemoryUsage + " MB");
        System.out.println("Memory reduction: " +
                           (100 - (virtualMemoryUsage * 100.0 / platformMemoryUsage)) + "%");
    }

    private static void executeBlockingTasks(ExecutorService executor, int count) {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(count);
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    // Simulate I/O blocking
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    latch.countDown();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }
        try {
            latch.await(2, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

    private static long measureMemoryUsage(Runnable task) throws Exception {
        // Run GC before measurement
        System.gc();
        Thread.sleep(1000);

        long before = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();
        task.run();
        long after = Runtime.getRuntime().totalMemory() - Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();

        return (after - before) / (1024 * 1024);
    }
}
```

### 2. Throughput Comparison
Create a simple benchmark application that:
1. Creates N tasks with platform threads (thread pool)
