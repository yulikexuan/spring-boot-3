1.  It is not always possible to write a default method that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation.
2.  In the presence of default methods, existing implementations of an interface may compile without error or warning but fail at runtime.
3.  Using default methods to add new methods to existing interfaces should be avoided unless the need is critical, 
      - in which case you should think long and hard about whether an existing interface implementation might be broken by your default method implementation.
4.  Default methods are, however, extremely useful for providing standard method implementations when an interface is created, to ease the task of implementing the interface
